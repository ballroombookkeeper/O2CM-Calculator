            <h3><strong>Understanding YCN Points</strong></h3>
            <p>
                More info can be found on <a href="http://ballroom.mit.edu/index.php/ycn-proficiency-points/">MIT Ballroom Team's Page on YCN Points</a> but for a quick summary, read on!
            </p>
            <p>The YCN point system determines eligibility for dancers at different levels.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Points apply to an individual dancer.</li>
                <li>To be eligible to compete in a dance at a given level, a dancer must have fewer than 7 point at that level for that dance.</li>
                <li>
                    A dancer must be eligible for all dances in an event in order to compete in that event.
                    For instance, a dancer may not dance in Silver Swing/Mambo if they have 7 points in Silver Swing (even if they only have 6 points in Silver Cha Cha, Rumba, and Mambo).
                    They may still compete in Silver Chacha/Rumba, and can double register in Gold Rhythm if the competition allows double registration.
                    If double registration is prohibited, they can only dance Gold Rhythm.
                </li>
            </ul>

                As this website uses data directly from <a href="https://o2cm.com/">O2CM</a> and does not pull data from other sources (such as <a href="http://www.dance.zsconcepts.com/results/">dance.zsconcepts.com</a>),
                points may be missing from some events.
                Addtionally, though we may try our best to be accurate, points may also be added from events (such as "Open Bronze") that are not meant to give points.
